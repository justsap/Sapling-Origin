-----------------------------------
Information:
		This datapack adds my personal origin, "Sapling"! This requires Origins Mod, APUGLI (or toomanyorigins mod if u want more origins), and Origins Extra Keybinds
	This origin has the following abilities:

	+ Poison Ivy [Toggled]: Whenever you punch a player or entity with this toggled, it poisons the target. This also makes it so any entity or player that hits you also gets poisoned (even if its not toggled)

	+ Grounded Roots [Activate]: You can protect yourself by summoning a bush-like structure and give yourself a bunch of defensive potion effects. This may seem overpowered, however it takes away 5 experience levels.

	+ Share Nutrients [Activate]: If in 4 block radius with a player or any land animal, you can create a circle that heals those inside it, but it takes away 1 XP level.

	+ Phasing Leaves: You can phase through leaves AND you move faster while doing it.

	+ Autotroph & Water: Sunlight gives you saturation, drinking water gives fills hunger points, and rain gives you regeneration, but being in darkness makes you weak, and you can't eat normal foods.

	+ Flammable: You burn in hot biomes and fire hurts more, but you can prevent it by wearing a full armor set of at least Fire Protection II..

	+ Childhood Biome: Your first spawn is always a forest biome.

	+ Remains: Upon death, you leave an azalea bush and you also have custom hurt & death sounds.

	+ No Shields
