-----------------------------------
Information:
		This datapack adds my personal origin, "Sapling"! This of course requires the Origins Mod. 
	This origin has the following abilities:

	+ Poison Ivy [Toggled]: Whenever you punch a player or entity with this toggled, it poisons the target. This also makes it so any entity or player that hits you also gets poisoned (even if its not toggled)

	+ Grounded Roots [Activate]: You can protect yourself by summoning a bush-like structure and give yourself a bunch of defensive potion effects. This may seem overpowered, however it takes away 5 experience levels.

	+ Phasing Leaves: You can move faster when phasing through leaves

	+ Autotroph & Water: Sunlight gives you saturation, drinking water gives fills hunger points, and rain gives you regeneration, but being in darkness makes you weak, and you can't eat normal foods.

	+ Burnable: You can't handle hot biomes and fire deals more damage to you, however you can prevent it by wearing full armor set of fire protection 3 or more.

	+ Childhood Biome: Your first spawn is always a forest biome

	+ No Shields
